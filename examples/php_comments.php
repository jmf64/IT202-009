//Here's a common single line comment, we use two forward slashes to comment out text on a single line
# using a hashtag/hash/pound symbol is another way to do a single line comment
# This is more often used in bash/sh scripts, but php support it. Some IDE's code highlighting may not correctly color code it for PHP
/*
This is a multiline comment.
Anything between these two tags will be "commented out".
You need to be careful with these as you can't nest them, but they're really helpful
when we want/need to have large comments or when we comment out a section of code we want to keep for historical purposes.
